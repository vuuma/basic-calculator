# Basic Calculator

A basic, barebones calculator built from scratch to practice my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
- Works on both integer and decimal numbers (floating points).
- Ability to string together several operations and get the right answer (i.e. 2 + 17 * 10 / 5 = 38).
- Clear button to clear the screen.
- Backspace button to remove a single digit or operator.


## Future Plans
- Round the result to two decimal places so it doesn't overflow the screen.
- Make the website more mobile friendly so it conforms to the size of mobile phones and tablets.
- The calculator's buttons can be activated by a computer keyboard.
